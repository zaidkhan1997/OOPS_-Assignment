    "#Answer: The five key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Encapsulation: This refers to the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate\n",
    "#on the data into a single unit, known as a class. Encapsulation also involves restricting direct access \n",
    "#to some of an object's components, which is achieved by making certain attributes or methods private and \n",
    "#providing public methods (getters and setters) to access or modify them.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Abstraction: Abstraction involves hiding the complex implementation details of a system and exposing\n",
    "#only the necessary and relevant parts. In OOP, this is typically achieved through abstract classes or \n",
    "#interfaces, which define the structure of classes but leave the implementation to be filled in by \n",
    "#subclasses.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Inheritance: This allows one class (a subclass) to inherit the properties and behaviors (methods) of\n",
    "#another class (a superclass). It promotes code reuse and establishes a relationship between parent and \n",
    "#child classes, where the subclass can extend or override the functionality of the parent class.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Polymorphism: Polymorphism enables objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common \n",
    "#superclass. It allows for methods to be used interchangeably across different classes. This is typically\n",
    "#implemented through method overriding (runtime polymorphism) or method overloading (compile-time polymorphism).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Composition: Composition refers to the concept where a class is composed of objects of other classes,\n",
    "#meaning an object can contain instances of other objects as part of its attributes. This allows for \n",
    "#building more complex objects by combining simpler ones, rather than relying on inheritance alone."
